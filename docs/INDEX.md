# Documentation Index

ctrlpane is an AI-first project management and notes platform with multi-tenant architecture, agent orchestration, and gamification. This index routes you to the right document based on what you need.

For the agent onboarding contract, start with [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repo root.
